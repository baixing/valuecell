Goal
Implement an All-Weather Portfolio strategy for US stocks that maintains structural diversification across asset classes, uses disciplined rebalancing rules, and captures upside trends through "trend-friendly selling rules."

Core Principles (Five Iron Rules)
1. Always hold all asset classes simultaneously (stocks, precious metals, BTC, commodities, bonds). Never liquidate any class based on market views.
2. No macro timing: Do not rotate based on "inflation/recession/recovery" predictions.
3. Rebalancing maintains structure, not predictions: Only trade when rules trigger.
4. Must replenish underweight positions: Underweight from declines is part of the all-weather structure.
5. Winners may exceed target, but with hard caps: Let winners run; force reduction when out of control.

Target Asset Allocation (Fixed Weights)
- Stocks: 50% (core)
- Precious Metals (Gold): 15%
- Bitcoin: 15%
- Commodities: 10%
- Short-term Bonds: 10%

Stock Bucket Breakdown (50% total)
- QQQ (Nasdaq 100): 20% - core holding
- SPY/VOO (S&P 500): 10%
- BRK.B (Berkshire): 10%
- IWM/VTWO (Russell 2000): 10%

Rebalancing Framework (Three Gates)
Gate 1: Hard Cap Risk Control (Highest Priority - triggers anytime)
Purpose: Prevent trends from turning portfolio into one-sided bet.
Trigger: Any asset class weight > hard cap
Action: Immediately sell to upper band (or target if weekly price breaks below 10-week MA)

Gate 2: Underweight Replenishment (Maintain all-weather structure)
Trigger: Any asset class weight < lower band
Action: Buy to restore to target weight

Gate 3: Winner Pruning (Trend-friendly selling)
Trigger (both conditions must be met):
- Weight > upper band (overweight)
- AND drawdown from recent peak >= drawdown threshold
Action: Sell overweight portion back to target (or upper band)
Key: Do NOT sell during uptrend just because overweight; wait for sufficient drawdown.

Band Parameters
Asset Class | Target | Lower Band | Upper Band | Hard Cap | Drawdown Threshold
Stocks      | 50%    | 40%        | 60%        | 65%      | 10%
Precious    | 15%    | 10%        | 20%        | 25%      | 8%
BTC         | 15%    | 10%        | 20%        | 30%      | 25%
Commodities | 10%    | 8%         | 12%        | 18%      | 15%
Bonds       | 10%    | 5%         | 15%        | 15%      | 4%

Execution Rules
- Check frequency: Monthly (first trading day) for review; Quarterly (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct) for mandatory review
- Minimum trade threshold: Skip if trade amount < 0.5% of total portfolio
- Use limit orders to reduce slippage
- Avoid first 5-10 minutes after open and extreme volatility near close
- For buys: Allocate to most underweight asset class first
- For sells: Sell from most overweight asset class first

Position Building Order (for new positions)
1. Stocks (QQQ, SPY/VOO, IWM, BRK.B)
2. Bonds
3. Precious Metals
4. Commodities
5. BTC (highest volatility, handle last)

Cash Flow Rules
- New funds: Buy-only priority; invest in most underweight class until at target
- Withdrawals: Sell from overweight classes first; if none, sell proportionally
- Dividends: Add to cash, deploy at next check date to replenish underweight

Drawdown Calculation
For each asset class, maintain Peak_i (update monthly):
- Peak_i = max(Peak_i, current price)
- Drawdown: DD_i = 1 - (Current_Price / Peak_i)

Prohibited Actions
- Never liquidate an entire asset class based on market views
- Never turn "drawdown pruning" into subjective judgment
- Never frequently adjust thresholds (avoid discretionary timing)
- Never use leverage (until complete leverage risk control system is established)

Rationale Requirements
- For each action: State which gate triggered, current vs target weight, and drawdown status
- For no action (NOOP): Explain why no gates were triggered (all weights within bands, no drawdown threshold met)

Summary
Maintain disciplined all-weather structure through fixed allocations and rule-based rebalancing. Let winners run until drawdown triggers pruning. Always replenish underweight positions. Never make macro predictions or discretionary trades.
